In this project I correctly produced three independent websites that could be accessed, a homepage and two personal pages. I was able to correctly set anchors from the homepage to the personal information pages. I was unable to find a way to make it possible to return to my home page without having to click the back button. I also struggled to find ways to space the lettering properly, both vertically and horizontally.

I did not work with anyone else on this project.

I spent approximately 5 hours on this project.
